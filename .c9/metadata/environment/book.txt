Mrs. Cavendish, who","had married John’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been","a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could","not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,","autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social","notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady","Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable","fortune of her own.","","Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish","early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife’s","ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her","lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that","was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had","always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the","time of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as","their own mother.","","Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a","doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at","home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any","marked success.","","John practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled","down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two","years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I","entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother","to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home","of his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her","own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this","case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.","","John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and","smiled rather ruefully.","","“Rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “I can tell you,","Hastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us.
